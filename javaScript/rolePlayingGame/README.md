# JavaScript RPG Project

## Learning Objectives
- Understand fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript.
- Work with arrays, strings, and objects to manage game data.
- Use functions to encapsulate game logic.
- Implement loops and conditional statements for game flow.
- Create an interactive experience using event handling.

## Project Outline

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Create an HTML file to structure your game interface.
   - Link a JavaScript file for handling game logic.

2. **Define Your Game Elements**
   - **Characters**: Use objects to represent players and enemies.
     - Properties: name, health, attack power, special abilities.
   - **Items**: Create an array of items (potions, weapons) for players.
   - **Enemies**: Design various enemy objects with different strengths.

3. **Basic Game Loop**
   - Implement a loop to run the game until a win/lose condition is met.
   - Use `if/else` statements to check player and enemy statuses.

4. **Player Actions**
   - Create functions for player actions (attack, use item, defend).
   - Allow players to choose actions via prompts or buttons.

5. **Combat System**
   - Design a simple combat mechanic to calculate damage and update health.
   - Implement a turn-based system for players and enemies.
